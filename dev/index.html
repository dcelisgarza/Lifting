He also takes at least 5 minutes between sets because he needs to replenish his &quot;ATT&quot;.</p><pre><code class="language-julia"># The arrays must all be of equal length.

Since Brosef only has passing knowledge of percentages, he follows his gut. Interestingly, this means he uses RPE, who&#39;d have thought?</p><p>Brosef is a straight shooter, so he only uses one set scheme, but there is flexibility to create more complex set schemes and arrays of set schemes (see <code>/assets/LiftingProgressions.jl</code>) do create more complex progressions. However, our boi &quot;be grindin&#39;&quot;–-evidenced by that one time he tried to sell you questionably-sourced protein powder–-he therefore has a straight forward progression that is still giving him linear gains in the same manner Jeffrey Epstein didn&#39;t kill himself. Of course, you&#39;ve slowly been creeping up on him while being half his size but what do you know, you&#39;re reading the documentation for a super niche product instead of benching your ass off.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">TheGrind = Progression(;

                      # must be equal to sessions * period.

He trains three days a week because he takes his recovery seriously and likes to party, so he can&#39;t no-life it like that jacked dude Brosef can totally out-bench.</p><pre><code class="language-julia"># Define the programme&#39;s concrete type.

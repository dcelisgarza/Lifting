Most definitely.\nWhat does it do? Lets you create and analyse lifting programmes.\nWhy not use a spreadsheet? This is more general and powerful than a spreadsheet but admittedly less approachable for less techy people.\nWhy not use an app instead? I use an app, Zero to Hero highly recommended. The premium version is cheap and lets you create and modify progressions, it is very, very good. I've also used TM Training in the past and it is also very good but can be annoyingly buggy. I can recommend them both. This serves a different purpose, it serves a more analytic and design-oriented purpose. The apps are great for logging.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Defaults-1","page":"Home","title":"Defaults","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"These are the default dictionaries defined in the programme.

Alternatively, additions may be made in their local environments, it will simply crowd your workspace.","category":"page"}]
